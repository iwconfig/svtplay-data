<h2 align="center">Anomalies</h2>

1. Due to a hard drive failure and the *lack of time* to fix the
   issue, there is a gap in the collection at about *16 days* between
   **2019-05-14 12:32:32** and **2019-05-30 20:36:24** where data has not
   been collected. This of course means that some data will be missing
   in this time period. **Most of it is probably about news broadcasts** which
   usually have an expiration date at about a week after it's live broadcast.
